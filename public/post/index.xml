      <description>Random Fourier Features (RFF), in my opinion, have one of the best performance-to-cost tradeoffs in machine learning techniques today. Simple to code, cheap to fit, and unreasonably effective, they have been my bread-and-butter for small-to-medium multi-dimensional learning tasks and serve as an decent baseline for more complex systems.&#xA;This post will be the first of a three part series on RFF:&#xA;Post I: This post will help to build intuition of RFF through low-dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved machine learning. Something about it has always felt like magic. When I first learned about prediction machines, in high school, to me, they always conjured images of The Oracle of Delphi or one of those old cartoons with a group of magicians huddled around a crystal ball. Ask the right questions, cast the right spells in the right order, and the seemingly impossible, a glimpse of the future, could be yours.</description>
