      <title>Learning Orthonormal Matrices for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>Prelude I have been researching alternative means to initialize and parameterize MLPs for use in deep learning pipelines. Orthonormal matrices continue to come up as a fundamental building block of some methods. This post is about my journey to find the fastest way to parameterize them in modern machine learning stacks.&#xA;Introduction to Orthonormal Matrices An orthonormal matrix is a square matrix whose rows and columns are orthonormal vectors. In other words, the dot product of any two different rows (or columns) of the matrix is zero, and the dot product of a row (or column) with itself is one.</description>

      <description>Random Fourier Features (RFF), in my opinion, have one of the best performance-to-cost tradeoffs in machine learning techniques today. Simple to code, cheap to fit, and unreasonably effective, they have been my bread-and-butter for small-to-medium multi-dimensional learning tasks and serve as an decent baseline for more complex systems.&#xA;This post will be the first of a three part series on RFF:&#xA;Post I: This post will help to build intuition of RFF through low-dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google. My current focus is on using machine learning to combat malware on Android devices. I have my BBA from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and a Masters in Statistics from the Racknam Graduate School at the University of Michigan. My research interests are in machine learning generally, including deep learning, business, and statistics.</description>
