      <description>Random Fourier Features (RFF), in my opinion, have one of the best performance-to-cost tradeoffs in machine learning techniques today. Simple to code, cheap to fit, and unreasonably effective, they have been my bread-and-butter for small-to-medium multi-dimensional learning tasks and serve as an decent baseline for more complex systems.&#xA;This post will be the first of a three part series on RFF:&#xA;Post I: This post will help to build intuition of RFF through low-dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google. My current focus is on using machine learning to combat malware on Android devices. I have my BBA from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and a Masters in Statistics from the Racknam Graduate School at the University of Michigan. My research interests are in machine learning generally, including deep learning, business, and statistics.</description>
