I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google. My current focus is on using machine
learning to combat malware on Android devices. I have my BBA from the Ross
School of Business at the University of Michigan and a Masters in Statistics
from the Racknam Graduate School at the University of Michigan. My research
interests are in machine learning generally, including deep learning, business,
and statistics.
